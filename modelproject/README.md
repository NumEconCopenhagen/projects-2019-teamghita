# Modelproject

Our modelproject, P vs. Q in environmental policy making, deals with the discussion regarding optimal policy instrument when dealing with environmental problems. We present and analyze three "P vs. Q"-type models (No uncertainty, uncorrelated uncertainty and correlated uncertainty).

The results of the project can be seen from running modelproject.ipynb.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires no further installations.

**Literature:** The literature used for this project can be found in the literatur folder.
